# Pandora restoration inventory and status

Baseline snapshot: 2026-10-12, merged source `22e55bb5`, restoration revision
`2f142cd09c5eae6d1edd001af3acfb2909098713d6a8f513eadda5c7279ba42e`.
All offsets here are section 0 source offsets, with exclusive range ends, unless
explicitly called runtime addresses. This report indexes native facts and
canonical history; it does not replace them. See the [full plan](pandora-restoration-plan.md).

## Complete byte accounting, incomplete semantic recovery

The [coverage map](pandora-coverage-baseline.tsv) contains 281 disjoint intervals
covering `[0, 376832)` (`0x5C000`) exactly. It was derived from native
`M68kSectionAnalysisIR.range_ownerships`, with residual spans explicitly unclaimed.
It records 47 merged code intervals, 119 accepted-noncode intervals and 115
unclaimed intervals. A complete partition is not a claim of complete analysis.

| Baseline native classification | Union bytes | Payload share |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Accepted code | 24,394 | 6.47% |
| Accepted noncode | 13,619 | 3.61% |
| No native ownership record | 338,819 | 89.91% |

There are 368 bytes with multiple accepted ownership claims, retained as overlap
flags; none is a code/noncode overlap. Raw byte preservation already works for
unclaimed spans. Their purpose, boundaries and consumers are not thereby known.
The largest unclaimed spans are `0xB4A8..0x3D310` (204,392 bytes),
`0x3E3FA..0x486BA` (41,664), `0x55370..0x5C000` (27,792) and
`0x4E94E..0x552DE` (27,024). These are not automatically valid asset extents.

Other baseline counts: 7,087 instructions; 448 accepted code runs; 2,070 CFG
blocks; 230 function candidates; 3,364 edges, including 64 unresolved transfers
(51 calls, 13 jumps); 48 table descriptors; 390 resolved and 21 unresolved typed
accesses. Existing manual state includes 234 labels, 95 seeds, 16 structures,
67 data layouts, 44 app/RSSET regions and 18 callable contracts. Before the new
startup batch, no manual comments existed and all 18 contracts left their effects
unknown. Legacy names are evidence to audit, not automatic semantic proof.

## Constraints established by the startup audit

The direct contract loads at runtime `0x20000`. Source `0x00..0x27` discovers
its current base and copies a 42-byte helper (`0x28..0x52`) to runtime `0x300`.
The helper copies `0x55370` bytes to fixed runtime base `0x10000`, choosing a
forward/backward byte loop to avoid overlap, then jumps to `0x1046A`.
The remaining 27,792-byte file tail is nonzero and its role is unresolved.

The fixed continuation installs a handler at vector `0x6C`, uses custom-chip
base `0xDFF000`, fixed application state and framebuffer addresses `0x70000`
and `0x78000`. These require distinct address classes: internal relocatable
pointers, fixed platform addresses and target-owned placement constraints.
PC-relative access to the star dispatch table does not make its longword entries
relative. Audio also has a distinct word-offset-plus-base dispatch idiom.

Five native runtime views include the input overlay, the materialized main copy,
the low-memory stub and competing off-by-one views. They are not five proven
execution copies. Of 943 address observations, 53 are recognized writes and 25
are runtime-range writes. None of those 25 intersects accepted code; indirect
writes, unaccepted code and conflicting views prevent concluding no gameplay
self-modification. Startup copying executable bytes is already established.

## Correctness findings to resolve

- **CFG address domain:** source `0x9C2A` contains absolute JSR `0x107F0`.
  Existing native runtime-reference facts identify source `0x7F0`, but the CFG
  used `0x107F0` as a source offset in the baseline. The reviewed generic
  resolver now consumes native runtime-reference identity, with conservative
  ambiguity handling. Synthetic runtime-base and Hunk tests pass; the current
  Pandora service confirms source `0x9C2A` calls source `0x7F0`. No fixed subtraction belongs in the framework.
- **33 misplaced legacy labels:** opcode table `0x1432..0x14B6` contains runtime
  handler pointers, but their labels were recorded as source-domain addresses.
  Example: `world_object_command_set_position` was placed at source `0x11114`;
  the accepted handler at `0x1114` writes A4+2/A4+4 into the object's world_x/y,
  advances A4 by 6 and returns. Each handler needs semantic corroboration before
  corrective actions; preserve the original history and append corrections.
- **Overlay extent:** initialization clears 128 bytes, the accepted queue layout
  covers 64, and processing scans 16 pointers. Adjacent ownership must be resolved
  before expanding a structure or claiming scheduling behavior.
- **History gap:** a pre-existing sequence jump from expected 940 to 943 remains
  visible. Do not renumber or rewrite historical bytes to conceal it.

## Derived subsystem ledger

“Unknown” below is an analysis status, not failure of exact source reproduction.
No subsystem is declared fully restored by the inventory.

| Subsystem / source region | Status | Evidence and next question |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bootstrap `0x00..0x52` | Reviewed interpretation; exact rebuild passed | Four labels and two comments describe fixed-base overlap-safe movement. Full-file C and vasm match; this does not establish alternate-base execution. |
| Runtime initialization `0x46A..0x5D6` | Hypothesis / partial | Audit stack/application memory, interrupt installation, framebuffers and initial resource consumers. |
| Interrupt hub `0x8E4`, frame service `0x94E` | Partial | INTREQR handling and callback slots exist; recover callback effects and inherited register context. |
| Title/starfield `0xBA8..0xF54` | Partial | Existing named star routines and dispatch facts; audit table bounds, continuations and state ownership. |
| World command interpreter `0x13F4`, table `0x1432..0x14B6` | Blocked by incorrect identities | Correct each of 33 handlers from dispatch and instruction evidence after CFG domain fix. |
| World/object/map logic and records | Partial | Existing object structures and link tables; follow interpreter consumers, proximity and object lifetimes. |
| Inventory `0x26EC..0x2B7E` | Partial | Names/fields exist; recover side effects and transitions after call identity reconciliation. |
| Text/overlay `0x6332..0x66A0` | Partial | Reconcile 128-byte clear versus 64-byte layout and indirect callback ownership. |
| Tile/geometry `0x6728..0x7216` | Partial | Identify buffer ownership, geometry extents and blitter/DMA address constraints. |
| Frame/gameplay `0x9C00` | Partial | Resolve absolute callees, frame wait/input helpers and front/back/display pointer lifetimes. |
| Security/trade/NPC callbacks | Partial | Existing names require contracts and cross-checks against world state/message consumers. |
| Audio `0x4D7DE..0x4E9D6` | Partial | Four-channel structures exist; recover command/state contracts and distinguish A3 module base/A6 hardware base. |
| Samples `0x4EAD8` onward | Partial / boundaries pending | Existing eleven packed-sample lengths need owner/consumer and exact extent reconciliation. |
| Large unclaimed intervals and uncopied tail | Unknown | Trace consumers and address-bearing content before claiming resource boundaries or opaque export safety. |
| Alternate execution layout | Not implemented/proven | Classify every address family, then test actual changed code/data/DMA placements and reject illegal layouts. |

The parallel asset-export task owns INCBIN packaging and assembler support.
This ledger can supply reviewed boundaries; it will not create a competing
export path. Original disk/loader parity remains explicitly out of scope.

## Framework repairs accompanying the startup batch

- Null or missing source coordinates no longer match unrelated legacy evidence.
  Concrete section/offset identity is required, including valid offset zero.
- Native-derived comment preflight rejects oversized or lossy text before atomic
  history writes. Undo/removal of invalid legacy comments remains possible. An
  attempted long startup comment was undone through the shared service; its
  record remains intact. See [the limits and storage proposal](../proposals/043-native-comment-contract.md).
- Restoration status polling retains failed build errors without retrying.
  Explicit retries and changed revisions still build, and active retries take
  precedence over older failures.

Focused validation: 57 listing/restoration tests, 135 comment/manual-log/catalog/CLI
tests, 12 runtime-domain/function integration tests, and 636 native IR tests.
These are focused results, not a claim that the full repository suite is green;
the previously identified Ancient decompression baseline failure remains.

- Naming the bootstrap exposed a runtime operand selecting its storage label
  before ORG. The renderer now retains the separate aliases and selects the
  runtime alias for an absolute reference at a materialized range start. Four
  exact-byte synthetic cases cover generated/named aliases, interior labels and
  identity mappings. The failed target proof is retained, not marked accepted.

Exporter PR2 was integrated from `3d68fba0` without conflicts. After rebuilding
the combined backend, 116 focused restoration/runtime-label/package tests passed.
No new resource classification was added just to enable asset extraction.

## Current original-layout proof

The combined backend produced exact original bytes with both the project
assembler and vasm: 376,832 bytes, SHA-256
`70480017cbedb4ed1d28c0bb190917720b8d2780914c37622b0df92c070aee8f`.
Verification receipt:
`3ac4af90cb7033c823720e589b6a918bcdd39c6796e0d8b13764908897f05438`.
The native service also confirms call source `0x9C2A` targets source `0x7F0`.
Post-integration native checks: 638 IR tests and five source-package tests pass;
the known Ancient unknown-payload identification test still fails.

The local service listens at `http://127.0.0.1:8123`; no public hosting was enabled.
Next substantive batch: corroborate and correct the 33 displaced world-command
handler identities, then recover their operand/effect contracts and startup
state dependencies. The full restoration and alternate-layout milestones remain
open; original disk/loader parity is outside scope.
