    - Word-offset table at $0E9A, 29 entries (base-relative to A1=$0EA2)
    - Separate MOVE.W reads offset from table; JSR dispatches via same base register
    - JSR dispatch targets injected into call_targets for subroutine map (+38 subroutines)
  - [ ] String dispatch table at pcref_3f3c: 65 assembler directives with self-relative handler offsets
    - Requires per-instruction state tracking (register modified in loop)
    - Code section reads resolve some indirect targets but not loop-based access
    - Data structure typing needs access-pattern analysis, not content scanning
  - [ ] Memory dispatch via d(A6) function pointers: executor needs to resolve
    MOVEA.L d(An),Am + JMP/JSR (Am) where stored values come from LEA d(PC)
    - Diagnostic hint: d(378)(A6) at $7612 has targets $2D2E, $9884 from 4 store sites

  - Jump tables as dc.w target-base, inline dispatch as decoded BRA instructions
  - 020+ instructions emitted with `; 68020+` architecture comments
  - LVO symbols, argument constants, struct field substitution, app memory offsets

- [x] LINK immediates — now from KB `immediate_range` (extension word displacement extraction)
